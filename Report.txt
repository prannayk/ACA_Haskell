PROBLEM : Design an n x n tic tac toe game in haskell for two players (not AI).
........................................................................................................

The game is designed for running in ghci.
Load the file in ghci with " :l TicTacToe.hs ".

To start the game, create a variable to store the matrix " let var1 = start n ".
This makes var1 a two dimensional array of characters, with the default character set to '.'.
n is the order of the matrix.

To make a move, i.e., to put an x (or o), use a new variable " let var2 = x 5 6 var ".
var2 is now the new matrix with an x put in coordinates (5,6).

For the next move, use " let var1 = o 4 3 var2 ".
var1 thus gets updated and the game can go on.

To display the matrix at any time, use " d var1 "
where var1 is the current state of the game.

TIME : 
The overall time taken is obviously proportional to the number of steps.
The time to make the first matrix is directly proportional to n, the order.
The time taken in the further steps, also, increases with the order.
